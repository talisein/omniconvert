Version 1.1.1 (2012-06-30)
	*	Fix intermittent crash when creating CBC files.
	*	Change cheat finalization to flag type 8 as an enable code when the cheat
		device is an Action Replay 2 (Version 1 or 2).  This primarily fixes 
		a problem where Swap Magic Coder files could not be created if a 9 type 
		enable code (conditional enable) was present in the input code list.
		
		(It seems that SMC does not support all the Action Replay 2 code types.  The
		device's translation and validation logic will need revision in a future
		version.)
Version 1.1.0 (2009)
	+	Added the ability to create Swap Magic Coder files.  Files are automatically
		generated with AR2 Version 1 encryption.
	*	Fix crash related to pointer write validation.

Version 1.0.3
      *		Bypass all verifier lines when translating AR MAX codes. Previously, they were
		analyzed and decrypted properly, but during translation only the first verifier
		line was discarded. Remaining lines were treated as codes, resulting in
		conversion errors.
      *		Bug that could occasionally result in multi-line code types being converted
		improperly for GameShark version 3+/Xploder version 4+. Specifically, if the
		second line started with a 7, the code would be discarded as though it was a
		Gameshark version 5 verifier line. Added logic to not discard if the previous
		line was identified as a two-line code type.


Version 1.0.2
	*	Resetting device encryptions so that CodeBreaker keys would be retained.
	+	Retrieve Game ID from edit box when the input device is not AR MAX, even if the
		verifier mode is Manual.

Version 1.0.1
	+	Added logic to remove BEEFC0DE and fix lines from CB enable codes during decryption.
		This will prevent the lines from being converted to another device, if present.
		This also prevents you from decrypting CB7 codes and re-encrypting to the same key.
		You cannot go from one CB7 encryption key to another without an intermediate step,
		but I can't imagine why you'd want to.
	+	Added check on the comparison size when the input is CB and the output is another
		standard device, such as GS3 or AR2.  Only CB and AR MAX support 8-bit tests.  
		This will probably have little effect on  anyone.
	*	Fixed the setting of the size parameter when converting an XP/GS/AR pointer write
		to CB.
	*	Made some minor modifications to the translation errors.

Version 1.0.0
	Initial release.
